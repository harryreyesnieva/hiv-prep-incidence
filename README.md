Lenacapavir, a long-acting injectable (LAI) capable of preventing HIV infection for up to six months, represents a major advance in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and has been hailed as a breakthrough in the fight against HIV. Despite PrEPâ€™s potential to reduce infection risk by up to 99% when taken as prescribed, adherence and persistence (the overall duration of treatment) remain suboptimal for daily oral regimens and the two-month LAI, cabotegravir. Globally, more than 1.3 million people acquired HIV in the past year, yet approximately 41% of individuals prescribed PrEP discontinued use within six months. Large observational data networks, such as the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) community, provide opportunities to study outcomes associated with these gaps. The aim of this study was to leverage the OHDSI data network to describe individuals who acquire HIV within six and twelve months of PrEP initiation, and quantify the proportion of individuals who acquire HIV and may benefit from this LAI recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
